# T-34 Assembler
T-34 Assembler is a tool designed to process assembly language code, converting it into machine-readable object files. This project includes a set of sample files and a Visual Studio solution for easy setup and development.

## Features
- Assembly to Object File Conversion: Converts .s assembly files into .o object files.
- Sample Files: Includes example assembly and object files for testing and reference.
- Visual Studio Integration: Comes with a ready-to-use Visual Studio solution for easy setup and development.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Visual Studio (with C++ development tools)
- C++ compiler

## Installation
1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/prarthavipatnekar/T-34-Assembler.git
```
2. Open in Visual Studio

Navigate to the project directory and open the T34 Assembler.sln file in Visual Studio.

3. Build the Project

Build the solution by clicking on the "Build" menu and selecting "Build Solution" or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+B. This will compile the source code into an executable.

## Usage
- Running the Assembler

After building the project, you can run the assembler using the generated executable. The assembler will take assembly files as input and produce corresponding object files.

- Using Sample Files

The project includes several sample assembly files (sample_*.s) and their corresponding object files (sample_*.o). These can be used to test the assembler's functionality or as a reference for creating new assembly files.
